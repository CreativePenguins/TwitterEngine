This is the README for the first assingment for COMP 330 - Software Engineering.
********************************************************************************

The goal of this assingment was to create an engine that can read and interpret,
to a point, twitter messages. Including, but not limited to, reading mentions,
topics, and URLs. I am going to try to implement this in C++ first as that is
what I'm most comfortable in right now, but may move to another language later
if C++ proves to be rigid. I don't think I should have a problem.

As for the daily commits that was supposed to happen starting Thursday Jan 28,
I wasn't able to start due to having to work and taking extra shifts for one of
my coworkers, but I should be able to start doing daily commits now and leading
up to the next class on Feb 4. I don't have any concerns about finishing this,
just wanted to let George know the situation.

For now this code will just take one tweet at a time, it can be later expanded
into being able to read from file and mark all tweets with different properties.
